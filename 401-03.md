# SQL Basics

## Selecting Queries

A query in itself is just a statement which declares what data we are looking for, where to find it in the database, and optionally, how to transform it before it is returned.

Syntax:

Select query for a specific columns:

`SELECT column, another_column, … FROM mytable;`

Select query for all columns:

`SELECT * FROM mytable;`

## Queries with Constraints

To filter results from being returned, we use a `WHERE` clause in the query. The clause is applied to each row of data by checking specific column values to determine whether it should be included in the results or not.

Syntax:
Select query with constraints
SELECT column, another_column, …
FROM mytable
WHERE condition
    AND/OR another_condition
    AND/OR …;
