# Markdown vs HTML

## *Markdown is easier than HTML and very easy to read.*

### Below is a snippet of some simple things you can use to code with both markdown and HTML.

* Variations of `#` Can be used for headings just as with HTML you would use `<h1>` for the biggest heading
* For markdown to create paragraphs you would just use plain text for what you want to code/write. For HTML you use `<p> </p>` to format lines of text
* To break text or start a new pargraph with markdown you would hit `enter/return`. For HTML you would use `<br>`
* For markdown to **bold** text you would use `**`. With HTML you would use `<strong> </strong>`
* For markdown to *italicize* text you would use `*`. With HTML you would use `<em> </em>`
* For markdown to ***bold and italicize*** text you would use `***`. With HTML you would use `<strong><em> </em></strong>`
