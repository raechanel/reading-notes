# How to make a wireframe?

## What is wireframe?

Wireframing is used by UX or user experience designers which allows you to defint and plan the deisgn of a website, app, or product. Wirefrraming is also a way to learn how a user interacts with your interface.

Some people like to draw their wireframes by hand. This can be useful because by using a whiteboard, paper, or pencil you have the advantage of it being very easy to be changed.

## Wireframing tools

## Different ways designers can structure the process from design to implementation

## Six Steps to make a wire frame

1. **Do your research**
    * UX design is a process. Before you put pen to a paper you need to have a clear understanding of who your audience is
2. **Prepare you research for quick refrence**
    * Scribble a cheatsheat with your business and user end goals/requirements, cool feautures you would like to include and anything else useful during this process.
3. **Have your user flow mapped out**
    *Have an idea of how many screens you'll need to produce and the flow you expect users to follow.
4. **Draft, don't draw. Sketch, don't illustrate**
    * During this step, you can finally put pen to paper. Remember that you're outlining and representing feautures and formats, not illustrating in fine detail.
    * Ask yourself the following three questions while you’re sketching:

        * How can you organize the content to support your users’ goals?
        * Which information should be most prominent?
        * Where should your main message go?
        * What should the user see first when arriving at the page?
        * What will the user expect to see on certain areas of the page?
        * Which buttons or touch points does the user need to complete the desired actions?

5. **Add some detail and get testing**
    * Add informational details to prepare the wireframe for the upgrade.
