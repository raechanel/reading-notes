# How to open a terminal?

#### How you open a terminal is easy but it differs depending on the computer system you are using. 

- When using a *MAC* you find `Terminal` by: **Applications** then **Utilities**. A quick shortcut you can use is by hitting `command+space` which will bring up the search and you will be able to type `Terminal`
- When using a *Linux* you find `Terminal` by: **Applications** then **System** or **Applications** then **Utilities**. Another option is by **right-clicking** on the desktop and the option **Open in terminal** will come up. 
- When using windows you will need a **SSH Client** 

Below I will list commands and their definition and function:
1. `pwd` means Print Working Directory. `pwd` tells you what your current or present working directory is. 
2. `ls`means list. `ls` list information about files and directories within the certain fie system. 
3. `cd`means change directory. `cd` allows you to move between directories 
4. `ls-a` will list hidden files and directories.
