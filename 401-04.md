# Java Basics

Review Based on [The Java Tutorials](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/variables.html)

## Variables

**Instance Variables** store their individual states in "non-static fields", that is, fields declared without the static keyword. Non-static fields are also known as instance variables because their values are unique to each instance of a class.

**Class Variables** A class variable is any field declared with the static modifier; this tells the compiler that there is exactly one copy of this variable in existence, regardless of how many times the class has been instantiated.

**Local Variables** Similar to how an object stores its state in fields, a method will often store its temporary state in local variables. The syntax for declaring a local variable is similar to declaring a field (for example, int count = 0;).

**Parameters** The args variable is the parameter to this method. The important thing to remember is that parameters are always classified as "variables"

## Operators

## Expressions, Statements, and Blocks

## Control Flow Statements

Statements break up the flow of execution by employing decision making, looping, and branching, enabling your program to *conditionally* execute particular block of code.
