# Arrays, Loops, Imports

Notes Based on [Java Imports](https://perso.ensta-paris.fr/~diam/java/online/notes-java/language/10basics/import.html):

* Java classes can be grouped together in packages
* To declare a package, the first statement must be the package declaration

Package Declaration Syntax:

1. Package statement (optional).
2. Imports (optional).
3. Class or interface definitions.

Example:

`package illustration;`

`import java.awt.*;`

`public class Drawing {
    . . .
}`

Notes Based on [Different Types of Loops in Java](https://www.baeldung.com/java-loops)

Looping is a feature which facilitates the execution of a set of instructions until the controlling Boolean-expression evaluates to false.

Java loops:

* *for* loop is a control structure that allows us to repeat certain operations by incrementing

* *for-each* loop
* *While* loop repeats a statement or a block of statements *while* it's controlling expression is true.
* *Do-While* loop is sort of like a while loops except the first condition evaluation happens after the first iteration of the loop.
