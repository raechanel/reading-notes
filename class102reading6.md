# JavaScript

JavasScript (JS) is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, and animate image.

## Three ways to declare a JavaScrit variable:

* Using ***var***
* Using ***let***
* Using ***const***


# Variables

Variables are containers for storing data (values)

Example 
 * For the example x, y, z are variables, declared with the ***var*** keyword. 
    * var x = 5
    * var y = 6 
    * var z = x + y
* So you can expect from the example above that:
    * x stores the value 5
    * y stores the value 6
    * z stores the value 11

In programming, just like in algebra, we use variables (like *x* ) to hold values.

In programming, just like in algebra, we use variables in expressions (total = x + y).

From the example above, you can calculate the total to be 11.

***JavaScript Variables are containers for storing data values***

## Identifiers

All JavaScript **variables** must be i**dentified** with **unique names.**

These unique names are called **identifiers.**

Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

#### Identifier Rules

The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.

Names must begin with a letter

Names can also begin with $ and _ 

Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)

Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names

***JavaScript identfiers are case-sensitive.***

# Assignment Operator

In JavaScript, the equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator.

This is different from algebra. The following does not make sense in algebra:

* *x=x+5*

In JavaScript, however, it makes perfect sense: it assigns the value of x + 5 to x.
* It calculates the value of x + 5 and puts the result into x. The value of x is incremented by 5.

***The "equal to" operator is written like == in JavaScript.***
