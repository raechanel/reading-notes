# What is git?
Git is  version control system that stores your data in snapshots of where you are in a certain point in time. Also, git allows multiple developers to work on the same code at the same time. 
### Stages
Files in github reside in three main states: `committed`, `modified`, and `staged`. 

*`Committed`* means data is securely stored in a local database. 

*`Modified`* means the file has been changed but not committed to the database. 

*`Staged`* means flagged a file's changed version to be commmitted in the next snapshot.
