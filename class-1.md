# Introduction to React and Components

1. **What is a “component”?**
  A component is a `software object`, intended to interact with other components, encapsulating certain functionality or a set of functionalities. It has an obviously defined interface and conforms to a recommended behavior common to all components within an architecture.
2. **What are the characteristics of a component?**
  `Reusability, Replaceable, Not Context Specific, Extensible, Encapsulated, Independent`
3. **What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?**
  `Ease of deployment, reduced cost, ease of development, reusable, modification of technical complexity, reliability, system maintenance and evolution, independent`
4. **What is “props” short for?**
  Props stands for `properties`
5. **How are props used in React?**
  Props are used for `passing data from one component to another`
  Step by step: Define an attribute and its value(data). Pass it to child component(s) by using props. Render the props data.
6. **What is the flow of props?**
  The flow is `uni-directional flow` (One way from parent to child)
