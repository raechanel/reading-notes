# Functional Programming

***

## Review Based on [Functional Programming Concepts](https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/concepts-of-functional-programming-in-javascript-6bc84220d2aa)

**What is functional programming?**

A style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data

**What is a pure function and how do we know if something
is a pure function?**

Definition of `purity`:

  1. It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
  2. It does not cause any observable side effects


**What are the benefits of a pure function?**

The code is `easier` to test

**What is immutability?**

When a data `state cannot change after it’s created`

**What is Referential transparency?**

When a function consistently yields the same result for the same input

## Review Based on [Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and require()](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHLd36QoS4k)

**What is a module?**

Another JS file

**What does the word ‘require’ do?**

Import a file in to be used.

**How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?**

`module.export = <function name>;`

**What do we have to do to make a module available?**

Require and export the module
