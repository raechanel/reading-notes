## What is Growth Mindset?

#### A growth mindest, to me, is a mindset that sees growth and development in every experience whether pass or fail. A mindset that ask the question `What does this situation teach me?` Seeing weaknesses as a chance to improve and building on strengths. 


#### I remind myself to keep a growth mindset by:
###### 1. Reflecting on where I am vs where I have been. Being grateful. 
###### 3. Thinking posititve. I am a firm believer that the way we talk to ourselves have a lasting effect. It's all about what you believe. 
###### 4. Staying humble. Always trying to learn from any situation.
