## What is Growth Mindset?

### A growth mindset, to me, is a mindset that sees growth and development in every experience whether pass or fail. A mindset that ask the question: `What does this situation teach me?` Seeing weaknesses as a chance to improve and building on strengths

### I remind myself to keep a growth mindset by

1. Reflecting on where I am vs where I have been. Being grateful

2. Thinking positive. I am a firm believer that the way we talk to ourselves have a lasting effect. It's all about what you believe

3. Staying humble. Always trying to learn from any situation
