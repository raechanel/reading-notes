# What is Growth Mindset?

#### A growth mindest, to me, is a mindset that sees growth and development in every experience whether pass or fail. A mindset that ask the question `What does this situation teach me?` Seeing weaknesses as a chance to improve and they build on their strengths. 

I remind myself to keep a growth mindset by:
1. Reflecting on where I am vs where I have been. Being grateful. 
3. Thinking posititve. I am a firm believer that the way we talk to ourselves have a lasting effect. It's all about what you believe. 
4. Staying humble. Always trying to learn from any situation.
