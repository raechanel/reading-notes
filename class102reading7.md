# JavaScript Functions and Operators

## JavaScript Functions

A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. It is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses **().**


Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).

The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)

The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}

* Example:

   function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
  // code to be executed

Function ***parameters*** are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition.

Function ***arguments*** are the ***values*** received by the function when it is invoked.

Inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) behave as local variables.

*A Function is much the same as a Procedure or a Subroutine, in other programming languages.*

## Function Invocation

The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:

When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
Automatically (self invoked)

## JavaScript Operators 


### JavaScript Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic on numbers:

* "+" means addition
* "-" means subtraction
* "*" means multiplication
* "**" means exponentiation
* "/" means division
* "%" means modulus (division remainder)
* "++" means increment
* "--" means decrement

***

## JavaScript Assignment Operators

Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables.

Examples:

* The **assignment** operator (=) assigns a value to a variable:
    * let x = 10
* The **addition** operator (+) adds numbers: 
    * let x = 5  
    * let y = 2 
    * let z = x + y

* The multiplication operator (*) multiplies numbers. 
    * let x = 5
    * let y = 2
    * let z = x * y

## JavaScript Compearison Operators

* '==' means equal to
* '===' means equal value and equal type
* '!=' means not equal
* '!==' means not equal value or not equal type
* '>' means greater than
* '<'means less than
* '>=' means greater than or equal to
* '<=' means less than or equal to
* '?' means ternary operator
