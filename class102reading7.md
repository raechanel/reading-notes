# JavaScript Functions

A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. It is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses **().**


Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).

The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)

The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}

* Example:

   function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
  // code to be executed

Function ***parameters*** are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition.

Function ***arguments*** are the ***values*** received by the function when it is invoked.

Inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) behave as local variables.

*A Function is much the same as a Procedure or a Subroutine, in other programming languages.*

## Function Invocation

The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:

When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
Automatically (self invoked)
